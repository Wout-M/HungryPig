# Hungry Pig

This project is a little game for [my friends PhD](https://www.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/portaal/#/projecten/3M210477?hl=en&lang=en). 
The game itself can be found [here](https://wout-m.github.io/HungryPig/)

There are 2 modes:
- **Dot Enumeration:** Each round has a picture with dots which the player has to write down the correct amount. 
- **(Non) Symbolic Comparison:** Each round has 2 pictures that are shown for 1 second. The player has to select the picture with the highest amount. There are 2 styles: dots & numbers.

At the end of each game, an Excel file can be exported with the results of the player.
